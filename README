Power Scheduler for Slackware Linux.

Allows setting up times for automatic wakeup and shutdown of your Slackware
box. Will only work on a mobo with functional Real Time Clock unit (rtc).
To verify your machive is equipped with rtc call 
ls /dev/rtc*
from terminal. If you see /dev/rtc0, you are good. If not, you are out
of luck, sorry.

Building:
Run ./power-scheduler.SlackBuild as root from the source directory.

Installing:
Use standard Slackware tools: installpkg, upgradepkg, pkgtool.
For example: sudo installpkg /tmp/power-scheduler-1.0.0-noarch-1_SBo.tgz

Configuration:
1. Make sure /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown is executable.
   sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
   It should also consist of a call to /usr/local/sbin/wakeup.
2. Set shutdown times by editing /etc/cron.d/shutdown-schedule.
   That is standard crontab file. Refer to man crontab for the instructions.
3. Set wakup times in /etc/wakeup-schedule.conf.
